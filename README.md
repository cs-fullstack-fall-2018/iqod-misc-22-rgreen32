# IQOD_Misc_22

Assume all child arrays are the same length. 

## DO EVERYTHING MANUALLY

```
array = [[4, 5, 6], [2, 3, 4], [7, 5, 3]]
```
Using the array above as an example and all child arrays are the same length, create a program that will add the first element of each child array together, then the next, etc. After you find the first element of each array print it out to the console.

<hr>
Example:

```
array = [[2, 3], [4, 3], [6, 7]]
iqod(array)
```
Output:

```
12
13
```
